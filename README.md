htn-stylus
==========

Stylus project for Hack the North 2014, completed in 36 hours.

See http://challengepost.com/software/inking-the-north for description.

In this project, we attempted to create a few innovative features for tablet stylus input, such as autocorrection and automatically generating neat XKCD-style graphs from a few broad strokes.

Note that as this was a hackathon project, the code was optimized for time and demo (duh!). Contact us if you need to know how to operate (what kind of strokes activate which feature).
